## Transformation Calculator
Overview
This project is a Transformation Calculator built in Java, designed to perform various unit conversions similar to those you might find when searching “from kg to lbs” on Google or Bing. The calculator supports transformations for gasoline consumption (e.g., MPG) and frequencies (e.g., Hz to GHz). The implementation adheres strictly to Object-Oriented Programming principles, avoiding the use of control structures like if, while, do, or for.

## Features
Gasoline Consumption Conversions: Convert between different units of fuel efficiency, such as miles per gallon (MPG).
Frequency Conversions: Convert between different frequency units, such as Hertz (Hz) to Gigahertz (GHz).

## Technologies Used
Java: The primary programming language used for this project.
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): The project is designed using OOP principles to ensure modularity, reusability, and maintainability
